Pour in the egg mixture and cook, stirring often, until the eggs are just set, about 1 to 3 minutes. Transfer the mixture to a bowl to pause the cooking process (the eggs will finish cooking in the quesadilla). Stir in the green onion, cilantro and jalapeño.",

Once the pan and tortilla are warm, sprinkle one-half of the cheese over one-half of the tortilla. Top the cheese with scrambled eggs, then top the scrambled eggs with the remaining cheese.",

Let the quesadilla cook until golden and crispy on the bottom (don’t stop cooking too soon!), about 1 to 2 minutes, reducing the heat if necessary to prevent burning the tortilla. Flip it and cook until the second side is golden and crispy.",
        "5. Immediately remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the quesadilla to a cutting board. Let it cool for a few minutes to give it time to set, then slice each quesadilla into 2 slices with a very sharp knife. Serve immediately, with your favorite salsa and/or hot sauce on the side."

Once frozen, add the milk and yogurt to the bowl of a large, high-speed blender with a tamper (see notes). Add the frozen blueberries, strawberries, banana, and broken up acai. With the blender on low, use the tamper to push the frozen fruit down, mixing around as much as possible. Continue to blend on low until smooth, only adding additional liquid when needed.\n3. Assemble. Divide the smoothie into two bowls and top with all your favorite toppings. Popular additions include sliced banana, nuts, seeds, granola, and berries. Best enjoyed immediately.",
